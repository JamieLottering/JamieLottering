### Welcome to Costco, I love you

I'm a software engineer specializing in frontend and UI development with over ten years of experience. In my spare time I've built an embeddable reactions-as-a-service called [VoteVibe](https://www.votevibe.com) and a Meetup.com for Animal Crossing called [NookWire](https://www.nookwire.com). For my day job I'm currently working at [HODINKEE](https://www.hodinkee.com/). I've previously worked at companies of all sizes from tiny to huge. Here's a curated list of some places I've been at:
